# Many Types Make Light Work

This is the talk I will be giving at [NSScotland 2014](http://nsscotland.com) in Edinburgh on October 26, 2014.


## Synopsis (for the conf)

Every programmer regularly faces the challenges of managing complexity and change. Subclassing can help us simplify, by sharing code and interfaces between related parts of our program. But when requirements change out from under our class hierarchy, unanticipated fragility can mean bugs, sweat and tears. Swift offers us a better way.


## TL;DR

Subclassing is a broken idea, so factor & compose instead where possible, and when Cocoa makes you subclass, do it in a factored, composable way.
